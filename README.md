# Rule Engine AST Project

## Overview
This project implements a simple Rule Engine that uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent rules. The Rule Engine allows you to create, combine, and evaluate rules based on logical operators such as `AND` and `OR`.

### Features
- **Create rules**: Convert a rule string into an AST.
- **Combine rules**: Combine multiple rules using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`).
- **Evaluate rules**: Evaluate the rules against user-defined data.
